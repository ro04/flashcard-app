# flashcard-app/node-express


Created the backend for a basic flashcard application. The backend essentially constitutes an API that allows for the creation of two types of flashcards.

- Basic flashcards, which have a front ("Who was the first president of the United States?"), and a back ("George Washington").

- Cloze-Deleted flashcards, which present partial text ("... was the first president of the United States."), and the full text ("George Washington was the first president of the United States."). 

The implementation of the front-end is completed, as well. https://onemc-flashcard.herokuapp.com/
